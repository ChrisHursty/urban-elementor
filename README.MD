# Urban Elementor Theme

Urban Elementor WP is a custom WordPress theme designed to work perfectly with the free version of Elementor

## Prerequisites

- WordPress environment (Local by Flywheel, XAMPP, MAMP, etc.)
- Node.js and npm

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
    Clone this repository into your WordPress themes directory.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChrisHursty/urban-elementor
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Theme Directory**:  
    Change to the theme directory.

3. **Install Node Modules**:  
    Install the required Node modules.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Install SASS (Maybe)**:  
    Install SASS.
    ```bash
    npm install sass
    ```
    I had to do this while testing on an (older) machine.

5. **Setting Local for Live Reload**
    Open the `gulpfile.mjs` and update the `proxy`:
    ```bash
    browserSyncInstance.init({
        proxy: "change_to_your_local_install.local/"
    });
    ```

6. **Running the Development Environment (`gulp serve`)**:  
    Start the development environment with live reloading.
    ```bash
    npx gulp
    ```
    This command starts a local development server with BrowserSync and watches your SASS, JS, and PHP files for changes, automatically reloading the browser.

7. **Building for Production (`gulp build`)**:  
    To prepare your theme for a production environment, use:
    ```bash
    gulp build
    ```
    This command runs tasks for compiling SASS, minifying CSS and JS files, optimizing images, and packaging your theme into a zip file. Ensure to run this command before deploying your theme.
